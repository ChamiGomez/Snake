# Snake

This is a basic creation of the common "Snake" game, whereby you control a snake trying to eat the Apples without running into yourself or the surrounding walls.
At the moment, there are no known issues with this program.

The code could be expanded in several ways:
  1) Using linked lists instead of vectors for larger snakes
  2) Expanding the class and using static variables to implement a levels system to the game
  3) Creating a time-based system where the snake automatically moves in the last given direction after a set timeframe
  4) Adding in obstacles for the snake within the playing area, potentially at higher levels
